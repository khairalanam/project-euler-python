"""
Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors
of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).

If d(d(n)) = n and d(n) â‰  n, then n is an "amicable number."

For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4,
5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, and 110, and their sum is
284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71, and 142,
and their sum is 220.

Evaluate the sum of all amicable numbers under 10000.
